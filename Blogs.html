            <h2>Stress</h2>
            <p>Since 1992, Stress Awareness Month has been held in April to raise awareness around stress and promote a stress-free lifestyle. 
               Despite this campaign running for almost 30 years, it is more prevalent than ever as stress remains an underlying issue in the UK.
               According to an NUS survey, 87% of students experienced stress, 77% experienced anxiety, and 48% experienced panic over the course of their study.</br></br>
               To mark Stress Awareness Month, we want to talk about stress and its effects. One thing we have learnt throughout the duration of our placement is that 
               everyone deals with stress in different ways – and some coping mechanisms can be less helpful than others.</p>

            <h2>What is Stress</h2>
            <p>At its most basic level, stress is the body’s response to pressures from a situation or life event – whether at work or in one’s personal life.</br></br>
               Stress isn’t always a negative response, either. That very feeling of pressure can often encourage people to push through difficult situations 
               and step out of their comfort zone, such as when presenting in front of a large group.</p>

            <h2>What are the signs of stress?</h2>
            <p>We all experience stress differently, and our responses can vary depending on the situation. Sometimes it is quite easy to tell that you are stressed, and 
               at other times you may not be able to recognise the signs in yourself.</br></br> 

               <b>How you might behave if you are stressed:</b></br></br>

               1. Unable to concentrate on assignments or exam revision</br>
               2. Becoming easily agitated, frustrated, and moody</br>
               3. Constantly worrying</br>
               4. Eating too much or too little</br>
               5. Attempting to ‘self medicate’ with other substances (e.g. caffeine)</br></br>

               <b>How stress might affect you physically:</b></br></br>

               1. Chest pain and a rapid heartbeat</br>
               2. Muscle tension</br>
               3. Headaches or migraines</br>
               4. Tiredness and a lack of energy</br>
               5. Problems getting to sleep</p>

            <h2>I'm stressed! What can I do about it?</h2>
            <p>We propose four tips to help you reduce your stress levels in the run-up to exam season:</br></br>

               <b>Stay organised</b></br></br>

              Keeping on top of everything in life will help you feel less anxious. Whether this be your workload of home life, a to-do list or a diary can help settle any fears
              of not being able to complete tasks on time.</br></br>

               <b>Take a walk</b></br></br>

              Removing yourself temporarily from the area you find stressful can help clear your mind and lift your mood. Take five or ten minutes to walk around the building or change
              up your working scenery to focus better on the task at hand.</br></br>

               <b>Reduce caffeine intake</b></br></br>

              Working long hours and struggling to get enough sleep leaves many of us reaching for a mug of coffee come 9am. Whilst it may create the illusion of increased concentration
              and productivity in the short term, cutting back to only one or two caffeinated drinks today can provide longer-term benefits such as helping you feel less anxious and uneasy.</br></br>

               <b>Talk about it</b></br></br>

              The easiest to say but often the hardest to do: ask for help or advice. Be mindful of your friends, too, and take the time to listen and understand what mindset they might be in.
              Don’t always send a text or email – speak on the phone or talk to them face to face if you have that option. This will not only give you a direct answer but will also reduce the 
              risk that your discussed will get ‘lost in translation’.</p></br>

            <h2>Anxiety</h2>
            <p>Even amid the rush of final exams and graduation celebrations at this time of year, college beckons with the chance to live on your own, find new friends, and explore interesting ideas. 
               Yet for college students — as well as high school students and parents craning for a glimpse down the road — these changes can also be stressful. Overnight, college students separate from 
               their traditional support system of family and friends. They also face many new challenges, such as living with roommates, managing heavy workloads, and developing an independent identity. 
               It's no surprise that anxiety often spikes during college. So, what do we know about anxiety during the college years? How can you cope if you're facing it? And can you take steps this summer 
               to help you handle anxiety when you head off to — or back to — a college campus?</p>
            
            <h2>What do we know about anxiety in college?</h2>
            <p>
             <b>It's common.</b> Anxiety in college is very common. According to the American College Health Association Fall 2018 National College Health Assessment, 63% of college students in the US felt overwhelming
             anxiety in the past year. In the same survey, 23% reported being diagnosed or treated by a mental health professional for anxiety in the past year.</br></br>

             The sharpest increase in anxiety occurs during the initial transition to college. A recent study demonstrated that psychological distress among college students — that is, their levels of anxiety, 
             depression, and stress — rises steadily during the first semester of college and remains elevated throughout the second semester. This suggests that the first year of college is an especially high-risk 
             time for the onset or worsening of anxiety.</br></br>

             <b>It's caused by many factors.</b> Many factors contribute to the heightened risk for anxiety among college students. For example, sleep disruption caused by drinking excess caffeine and pulling all-nighters 
             is associated with increased anxiety among college students. Loneliness also predicts mental health problems, including anxiety. Academic factors like school stress and disengagement from studies are 
             also associated with psychological distress among college students.</br></br>

             <b>It may be on the rise.</b> College students today appear to be more stressed and anxious than ever before. A recent study in Sweden showed that anxiety levels have increased in recent years, especially among
             young adults. In the US, some research shows a decrease in psychological well-being among adolescents over the past several years. It's not entirely clear what is causing this trend, though research 
             shows a strong association between time spent on electronic communication (social media, smartphones) and reduced well-being among adolescents. Electronic communication might interfere with adjustment 
             to college if it replaces healthy coping behaviors like exercise, face-to-face social interactions, and studying.</p>

            <h2>How to cope with anxiety in college</h2>
            <p><b>Approach, don't avoid.</b> College is challenging and many students cope by avoiding stressors (skipping class, staying in bed all day). However, we know that avoidance tends to make anxiety worse over 
               time. Instead, practice taking small steps to approach anxiety-provoking situations. If you're struggling in a class, try emailing the professor for help. If you're feeling lonely, try introducing 
               yourself to someone in the dining hall. Not at college yet? Practice this skill over the summer by participating in pre-college programs on campus.</br></br>

               <b>Practice self-care.</b> Many students struggle to maintain healthy eating habits, consistent exercise, and regular sleep without the structure of home. But self-care behaviors like these are extremely 
               important for regulating mood and helping people cope with stress. Try to establish your own self-care routine — preferably before you even start college. Good sleep hygiene is key. Set a consistent
               bedtime and wake-up time each day. Avoid using your bed for activities other than sleep, like studying. Limit caffeine in the evening and limit alcohol altogether, as it interferes with restful sleep.</br></br>

               <b>Find resources on campus.</b> Many colleges offer resources to help students navigate the initial transition to campus and cope with stress. Investigate campus resources for academic advising, study 
               support, peer counseling, and student mental health. If you've been diagnosed with a mental health issue, such as an anxiety disorder, you may also want to find a mental health provider near campus.
               If you struggle with anxiety and you'll be starting college next year, you may find it helps to establish a relationship with a therapist beforehand.</br></br></p>

            <h2>Depression</h2>
            <p>So basically, depression in college students is a natural mental illness that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest in the student’s mentality. It’s called in different things like major
               depressive disorder, major depression, clinical disorder.</p>

            <h2>Dude, I’m Sad. Does that mean I’m Depressed?</h2>
            <p>There is a significant discrepancy between being sad and being diagnosed as depressed. Sadness is a normal human emotion that everybody experiences from time to time, and it’s also a feeling that 
               tends to ratify. Clinical depression, on the other hand, is something that perseveres, lingers, and hangs on for a longer time. Though the symptoms are similar, depression doesn’t go away, and it
               seems more severe in a lot of ways.</p>

            <h2>How does a person tell if they are sad or in a clinical depressive state?</h2>
            <p>College students and depression have stayed together for a longer period than any other age group.</br></br>

               For a college student, it depends on how we are involved with someone who may be exhibiting these types of symptoms. It’s essential to recognize that sometimes we have to see those indications in 
               other people. We have to look for isolated behavior in others or anything that is out of character.</br></br>

               In extreme depressive state conditions, students might have suicidal thoughts too. A college student undergoing depression might make statements like “things might be better if I just weren’t here.” 
               or giving away possessions. This really might be a warning sign that something is not quite right.</p></br></br>

            <h2>Symptoms of depression in college students</h2>
            <p><b>Being in a depressed mood on most days</b></br></br>
               A mood disorder comes under major depression, which influences the feeling of life.</br>

               The most widespread symptom is having a hopeless and helpless opinion on your life.</br>

               Other sentiments may be worthlessness, self-disgust, and inappropriate remorse.</br></br>
 
               <b>Loss of interest or fun in most activities</b></br></br>
               Depression can take the joy and happiness out of the things you love. A loss of attention or isolation from activities that you earlier looked forward to — hobbies, sports, or spending time with 
               friends.</br></br>

               <b>Significant weight loss or gain.</b></br></br>
               This one is a physical indication of depression. Weight loss or gain is common due to the amount of stress we carry. It is a noticeable symptom that goes by a saying that “nowadays, you look too thin,
               you must be depressed. What happened?”</br></br>

               <b>Fatigue or low energy almost every day</b></br></br>
               Always feeling extremely tired, which stops you from doing things that you enjoy. One of the most enfeebling indications of depression is the severe sensation of fatigue. This leads to uncontrolled 
               sleeping.</br></br>

               Sometimes insufficient sleep steers to anxiety.</br></br>

               The DSM(Diagnostic Statistical Model) states that you need at least five of these for two weeks to be considered in depression. This is because it is an extended amount of time you feel this way.</p>

            <h2>Causes of mental health issues in college students</h2>
            <p>The combination of college students and depression produce more mental health issues than in any other state.</br></br>

               Often when you start in college, you assume that you can do things all on your own. So it’s not being intimidated or afraid to say I don’t understand or I do need somebody to connect with.</br></br>

               In a survey,</br></br>

               - 80% of students felt overwhelmed by the workload.</br>
               - 45% felt things were hopeless.</br></br>
               Students worrying about having low grades, which can affect their future is one of the significant causes of depression in college students.</br></br>

               People need to hear what mental health is and also how to overcome it. You don’t have to feel guarded all the time, and you could be upfront with how you think.</p>

            <h2>How to solve this problem?</h2>
            <p>College students and depression together creates a big problem but together only they form a solution.</br></br>

              - You can always go to your family practitioner and discuss the issue in detail if you’re comfortable with that person.</br></br>
              - Medication is an option, and your family doctor can help you with that.</br></br>
              - Contact mental health agencies that specialize more in this kind of problem.</br></br>
              - In extreme conditions, you should go to counselors and psychiatrists to do appropriate evaluations and recommend necessary treatment.</br></br>
              - Catch these problems as fast as possible so that it doesn’t get out of control that hospitalization is needed.</br></br>
              - Social support is always helpful, like being around the people who care about us.</p></br></br>
