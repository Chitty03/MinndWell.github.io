                Mindwell company is a concept centered around mental health. It aims to provide crucial support to students facing
                mental health challenges. Mindwell is also a company that recognizes the importance of mental well-being. Currently, the
                company is seeking to implement an online system to help INTI students in mental health support where students do not have
                to find any therapist outside without spending huge sum of money. In INTI, there might be a high demand for mental health
                services. However, there is a lack of accessible online applications that can offer the necessary assistance. It remains difficult
                to find and match individuals with the right mental health resources.

                    What is stress? Stress is our body's response to pressure. Many different situations or life events can cause stress.
                    It is often triggered when we experience something new or unexpected that threatens our sense of self or when we feel we
                    have little control over a situation.
