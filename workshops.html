                <p> A mental health workshop for students aims to provide valuable knowledge and support to help students
                    navigate the challenges and pressures they may face in their academic and personal lives. These workshops
                    typically focus on promoting mental well-being, building resilience, and developing coping strategies. 
                    Through interactive sessions, students can learn about stress management, self-care practices, effective 
                    communication, and seeking help when needed. The workshops also create a safe space for students to share 
                    their experiences, ask questions, and engage in discussions about mental health. By raising awareness and 
                    equipping students with the necessary tools, mental health workshops empower them to prioritize their mental
                    well-being and thrive academically and personally. Through interactive sessions, students can learn about stress management,
